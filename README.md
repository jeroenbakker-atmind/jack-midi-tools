# jack-midi-tools
Jack Midi client applications to use for music creation. It started as a hobby project where the goal is to use midi events to alter visual animations.

- Contains an easier to use API for creating jack modules. Hiding most of the complexity so module developers can concentrate on what they want to implement.
  - Currently only midi-in has been implemented. Other ports and transport between ports will be added when needed.
- Minimal example for logging midi inputs has been added. It logs any raw midi event to the terminal/console.
